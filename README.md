## Overview

- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Links

- [Live site](https://modji.github.io/fementor-productpreview/)

## My process

### Built with

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned

I learn the existence of the `picture` HTML element. It allowed me to switch images between desktop and mobile.

### Continued development

My biggest issue was that I didn't realize that I had a dedicated image for the desktop. I had to search for a solution and found the use of `<picture>`. This allowed to swtich bettween images. I found that `srcset` didn't really work well for me.

### Useful resources
